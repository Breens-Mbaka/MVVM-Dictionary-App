### Architecture
The app was primary built with the MVVM design pattern in mind. I decoupled the business logic from the UI and thus lead to benefits like:

* Increased testability of the UI and business logic separately
* Increased maintainability and readability due to the less decoupling of classes
* Allowed as to implement unidirectional data flow that reduced bugs since we had one single source of truth
